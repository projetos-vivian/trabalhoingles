				<h2>The influence of <span class="color">technology</span> on mankind.</h2>
				<div class="border"></div>
			</div>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the emergence of the Internet, it has been influencing the lives of human beings more and more, whether it is making a simple action such as a phone call to some person relatively far away, or programming a sequence of algorithms that solve for you multiple well-structured and diverse mathematical calculations. </p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"> And as you can see, technology is constantly evolving in different aspects, such as the audiovisual revolution that made it gain more notoriety in its influence on human behavior. And with this as its basis, the goal of this blog will be to inform some technologies that constantly influence society, with the intention centered on demonstrating various personal ways to have access to or acquire knowledge of such behavioral changes.
 					After the development of this means of communication major transformations such as the passage of paper newspapers to the digital medium in order to transmit information to a larger number of people and age groups thus bringing greater ease of access to information by professionals in the field of journalism before seen only in traditional ways and media were and are becoming increasingly common.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology if well used can yield great forms of money or even help people, as an example, make a person who was born without an arm or leg, have one using a prosthesis, and with technology times later came the internet, which if used in a good way you can always keep informed and even help multiple people, But just as the internet was one of the best things ever created by the human being, it was also one of the worst, because of its free and vast access, many people post things that are repulsive and even stomach churning, and moreover there are other people who deceive men, women and even children by asking for specific information that makes them steal many things and even their money.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"> Much of the knowledge we acquire through our relationships with the environment also influences the perception of the naturalness of the media, and causes man to learn various forms of communication even with the strangeness he may initially feel. Thus demonstrating that the human being ends up being able to biologically adapt to the transformations promoted by rapid technological advancement, holding the journalist Muller(2016), never before in history have we had the habit of sleeping and waking up with an electronic apparatus. Therefore, technologies influence the human being in the same way that the human being also influences the growth of technologies.</p>

						<h2>Progress of <span class="color">technology.</span></h2>
						<div class="border"></div>
					</div>

					<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; text-align: justify;">The influence of technology on humanity has its positive and negative points, but obviously much more positive.  If we used it in a moderate way and if everyone had the same awareness, for sure everything would be perfect; nowadays it is impossible to point out a sector of the market that has not been widely influenced by the emergence of new technologies, and this is wonderful. From the advances in medicine to the entry of robots into industry, and the discovery of cures for diseases. Nowadays, with technology everything has become easier, we do everything by cell phone, we eat very little, we call cabs, we make transfers, payments, talking to people on the other side of the world, shopping at the market, in just two minutes we do all this and much more, and this is wonderful because it facilitates the life of any person, especially those who are in a hurry. 
					But as everything has its pros and cons, the part of being able to do absolutely everything by cell, made us dependent on it, which leaves us addicted and we end up isolating ourselves socially, no longer having social interaction, with family, friends and this ends up pushing us away from those we like and then many conflicts begin to arise, but for others the Internet is the solution to get out of conflicts, whoever they are with. One example is the dating applications, where several people met their current spouses or even made friends for life. Other examples that are changing the world are: artificial intelligence, machine learning brings a huge potential for the creation of relevant products and services. Examples of artificial intelligence and machine learning: hospitals using digitized image libraries to detect and diagnose cancer quickly and accurately; insurance companies digitally recognizing and automatically assessing damage to vehicles; security companies replacing misspelled passwords with voice recognition. </p>
					<p  style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%; text-align: justify;">Another example is Drones, which play a hugely important role; companies are using this technology for various purposes, such as surveillance, research, sports, cinematography, and product delivery. Understanding how these devices can impact your business is part of preparing for the future. The term blockchain refers to a distributed digital database. More generally, we could say that it is a "digital ledger" that uses software algorithms to reliably and anonymously record and confirm transactions. Because of this, the technology is essential and has great potential to usher in an era of autonomous and more secure digital commerce. Technology is becoming more important every day, it is evolving faster and faster, and it is very amazing to see this happening, if we search the internet, there will appear thousands of sites talking about technologies that will change and innovate the world, and are invented by people/faculty/laboratories/schools who are determined of themselves and have faith and expectation in their ideas, who are looking for a better world. So this is the area that I want to follow, the area of computer science that totally involves technology, it's becoming more important and innovative every day and I definitely want to be part of it.</p>
